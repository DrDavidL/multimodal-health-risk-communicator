The good news is that your screening shows that diabetic retinopathy is unlikely. This means that, based on the information we have, your eyes appear healthy. The screening also stated that the predicted severity if present is \"no apparent retinopathy.\"\n\nYour screening assessment, which is a preliminary evaluation, also indicates that diabetic retinopathy is unlikely.\n\n**Connecting Your Eye Health to Your Diabetes**\n\nIt's important to remember that diabetes can affect your eyes, a condition called diabetic retinopathy. However, with good diabetes management, we can significantly reduce the risk of developing this condition.\n\nYour HbA1c is 5.8%, which is in the pre-diabetic range. This is good news, as it shows that you are managing your blood sugar well. Your fasting glucose is also within a normal range. The CGM data shows that you are spending a high percentage of your time in the target glucose range, which is excellent.\n\n**What You Should Do Next**\n\nSince your screening results suggest a low risk of diabetic retinopathy, and you are managing your diabetes well, we recommend a routine screening every year.\n\n**Key Points to Remember**\n\n*   Your retinal screening results indicate a low risk of diabetic retinopathy.\n*   Good blood sugar control is crucial for preventing diabetic retinopathy.\n*   Regular eye exams are essential for detecting and managing any potential eye problems related to diabetes.\n\n**Questions to Ask Your Eye Doctor**\n\n*   What are the specific factors that contribute to my low risk of diabetic retinopathy?\n*   How can I continue to improve my blood sugar control and eye health?\n*   Are there any other eye conditions I should be aware of, given my diabetes and other health factors?\n",
    "gpt5_report": "## Understanding Your Retinal Screening Results\n\nYour eye photo screening did **not** show signs of diabetic retinopathy. Diabetic retinopathy is damage to the small blood vessels in the back of the eye (the retina) that can happen after long-term high blood sugar. Based on this screening, **diabetic retinopathy is unlikely**, and the urgency level is **routine**.\n\nThis result is **probabilistic**, meaning it gives a \u201cbest estimate,\u201d not a final yes/no answer. **If we screened 10 people with similar results, about 1 would have diabetic retinopathy and about 9 would not.** Screening tests can sometimes miss early disease or flag something that turns out not to be a problem, so the safest plan is to keep up with regular eye exams.\n\nThe screening also found **age-related macular degeneration (AMD)**. AMD is a common age-related change in the macula (the part of the retina used for sharp, central vision). This does **not** mean you are going blind, but it is important to discuss with an eye doctor so they can confirm it and guide next steps.\n\n## Connecting Your Eye Health to Your Diabetes\n\nDiabetic retinopathy risk is strongly linked to blood sugar over time. Your lab HbA1c is **5.8**, which is in the **pre-diabetes** range (higher than normal, but not in the diabetes range). Your continuous glucose monitor (CGM) also looks steady: average glucose **107 mg/dL**, and your readings were in the usual target range (**70\u2013180**) for **about 99 out of 100** readings. You had **about 1 out of 100** readings below 70 and **0 out of 100** above 180.\n\nIn general, steadier blood sugar patterns lower the chance of diabetes-related eye damage. Your current glucose pattern supports why the screening suggests retinopathy is unlikely. Still, eye health can change over time, and AMD is a separate finding that deserves follow-up.\n\n## What You Should Do Next\n\n- **Routine follow-up:** Continue your **regular yearly eye exams** as recommended for people with diabetes (and often also recommended for people with pre-diabetes or higher risk).\n- **Confirm the AMD finding:** Ask for a **dilated eye exam** (drops that widen the pupils) and whether any **retina imaging** is needed to confirm AMD and check how mild it is.\n- **Support eye and overall health:** Work with your primary care clinician on steps that can improve long-term risk, such as healthy weight goals (your BMI is 33.6), blood pressure maintenance (124/70 is good), and triglyceride improvement (168 is mildly high).\n\n## Key Points to Remember\n\n- This is a **screening**, not a definite diagnosis; it\u2019s meant to guide what to do next.\n- **Out of 10 people like you, about 1 may have diabetic retinopathy and about 9 may not.**\n- Your screening image showed **no apparent diabetic retinopathy**, and the plan is **routine** follow-up.\n- **AMD was detected**, so it\u2019s important to discuss it with an eye doctor even though retinopathy looks unlikely.\n\n## Questions to Ask Your Eye Doctor\n\n1. \u201cCan you **confirm whether I have AMD**, and if so, what type and how mild is it?\u201d\n2. \u201cDo you see **any early signs of diabetic retinopathy** on a dilated exam, even if the screening looked normal?\u201d\n3. \u201cHow often should I have eye exams given my **pre-diabetes (A1c 5.8)** and this screening result?\u201d",

This means that your eye doctor thinks it's very unlikely that you have diabetic retinopathy based on the exam. The assessment also indicates that if you *did* have diabetic retinopathy, it's not currently visible. This is good news!\n\n**Connecting Your Eye Health to Your Diabetes**\n\nIt's important to remember that managing your diabetes is key to protecting your eyes. Your HbA1c is normal at 5.0%, which means you're doing a great job keeping your blood sugar in a healthy range. Also, your CGM shows that you're in range about 77% of the time, which is excellent! You're consistently keeping your glucose levels within the target range.\n\nHowever, because you are obese (BMI 35.8) and have a slightly elevated LDL cholesterol (93 mg/dL), there are some other factors to consider for your overall health, including your risk for developing diabetic retinopathy.\n\n**What You Should Do Next**\n\nSince your screening showed a very low risk of diabetic retinopathy, and your glucose levels are well-controlled, you don't need to do anything specific immediately. However, it's a good idea to continue monitoring your blood sugar regularly with your CGM. Following your doctor's recommendations for general diabetes management, including a healthy diet and regular exercise, will continue to help protect your vision.\n\n**Key Points to Remember**\n\n*   Your retinal screening was reassuring, showing a very low chance of diabetic retinopathy.\n*   Your HbA1c is within the normal range, and your CGM shows good glucose control.\n*   Maintaining a healthy weight and managing cholesterol levels are important for overall health and potentially reducing long-term risks.\n\n**Questions to Ask Your Eye Doctor**\n\n*   How often should I have another retinal screening?\n*   Are there any other eye health concerns I should be aware of, given my diabetes and other health factors?\n",
    "gpt5_report": "## Understanding Your Retinal Screening Results\n\nYour eye photo screening did **not** show signs of diabetic retinopathy. The grade was **\u201cno apparent diabetic retinopathy,\u201d** and the overall assessment is that diabetic retinopathy is **unlikely**. Your urgency level is **ROUTINE**, meaning nothing in this screening suggests you need an urgent eye visit.\n\nThis result is **probabilistic**, which means it estimates how likely a problem is, but it does not give a definite diagnosis. Based on this screening, the chance of diabetic retinopathy is about **0 out of 10 people** with similar results (and about **10 out of 10 would not** have it). Because all screenings can miss early or subtle changes, it\u2019s still important to keep up with regular eye exams.\n\n## Connecting Your Eye Health to Your Diabetes\n\nDiabetic retinopathy is damage to the small blood vessels in the back of the eye (the **retina**, the \u201cseeing layer\u201d). It is most often linked to long-term high blood sugar. Your lab numbers suggest **healthy average blood sugar** (HbA1c **5.0**, estimated CGM A1c **about 5.5**), which supports the low likelihood seen on the eye screening.\n\nThat said, your CGM shows **blood sugar swings**, including **lows**: about **2 out of 10 readings** were below 70, and about **0 out of 10 readings** were very low (below 54) at times. Big ups and downs can affect how you feel day to day and can be a safety concern, even if the average is okay. Keeping glucose steadier is generally helpful for overall health, including eye health.\n\n## What You Should Do Next\n\n- **Continue routine yearly eye exams** as recommended (even when the screening looks normal).\n- Bring this screening result to your next eye appointment and ask if you need any follow-up photos or a dilated eye exam (an exam where drops widen the pupil to see the retina better).\n- Because your CGM shows **frequent lows**, talk with your primary care clinician about possible causes (meal timing, medications/supplements, illness, alcohol, or sensor issues) and how to reduce lows safely.\n- Keep working on heart-and-vessel health (important for eyes too): your blood pressure and cholesterol look generally good; ask your clinician for a plan that also supports weight and overall fitness.\n\n## Key Points to Remember\n\n- This was a **screening**, not a final diagnosis\u2014but it looks **reassuring**.\n- If we screened **10 people** with similar results, about **0 would have diabetic retinopathy** and about **10 would not**.\n- **Yearly eye exams** are still important because early changes can be missed or develop later.\n- Your average glucose looks healthy, but your CGM shows **more lows and variability** than expected\u2014worth reviewing with your clinician.\n\n## Questions to Ask Your Eye Doctor\n\n1. \u201cDo you recommend a **dilated eye exam** even though my screening was normal, and how often should I repeat screening?\u201d\n2. \u201cAre there any **early or subtle retina changes** you want to watch over time based on my images?\u201d\n3. \u201cGiven my health history, what are the best steps to **protect my vision** over the next year?\u201d",

This means there is a significant chance that you have some changes in your blood vessels in the back of your eye due to diabetes. The screening assessment confirms this likelihood, and the predicted severity indicates that the changes are likely to be more advanced. The urgency level is URGENT, meaning this needs to be addressed promptly. It's important to remember that this is a screening result and doesn't mean you have diabetic retinopathy, but it does indicate the need for further evaluation.\n\n**Connecting Your Eye Health to Your Diabetes**\n\nYour diabetes is a major factor contributing to the risk of diabetic retinopathy. Your HbA1c (8.0%) and fasting glucose (178 mg/dL) are both within the diabetic range, indicating that your blood sugar levels are higher than they should be. This high glucose level can damage the small blood vessels in your eyes, leading to diabetic retinopathy. The CGM data shows that you are spending a significant amount of time outside of the target glucose range (above 180 mg/dL). This further stresses the blood vessels and increases the risk of diabetic retinopathy.\n\n**What You Should Do Next**\n\nBecause your screening results show a high probability of diabetic retinopathy and the urgency level is URGENT, you need to schedule an eye exam with a retinal specialist as soon as possible. This exam will allow the specialist to thoroughly examine your retina and determine the extent and severity of any changes. Following the eye doctor's recommendations is crucial for managing your diabetic retinopathy and protecting your vision.\n\n**Key Points to Remember**\n\n*   Your high blood sugar levels are a major risk factor for diabetic retinopathy.\n*   The urgency level indicates that this needs to be addressed quickly.\n*   A comprehensive eye exam is essential to evaluate the extent of any changes.\n*   Early detection and treatment can help prevent vision loss.\n\n**Questions to Ask Your Eye Doctor**\n\n*   What is the specific type and severity of diabetic retinopathy I have?\n*   What are the treatment options available to me?\n*   How can I improve my blood sugar control to reduce the risk of further damage?\n*   How often should I have follow-up eye exams?\n*   Are there any lifestyle changes I can make to protect my vision?\n*   Are there any resources or support groups available to help me manage my diabetes and diabetic retinopathy?\n",

The probability is about 1 out of 10. This means that, based on your screening results, there's a small risk of developing diabetic retinopathy in your eye. However, your screening assessment showed that diabetic retinopathy is unlikely.\n\nYour predicted severity if present is no apparent retinopathy, which means that if you were to develop diabetic retinopathy, it's not currently visible during the exam.\n\nYour urgency level is ROUTINE, which means you do not require an immediate follow up.\n\n**Connecting Your Eye Health to Your Diabetes**\n\nIt's important to remember that diabetic retinopathy is a common complication of diabetes. Good blood sugar control is the best way to prevent or delay the onset of diabetic retinopathy.\n\nYour HbA1c is 7.3%, which is in the diabetic range. This indicates that you are managing your diabetes with medication. Your CGM shows that you are spending about 87.6% of the time within your target glucose range, which is a good sign. However, about 12.4% of the time your glucose is above your target range.\n\nYour lipid panel shows that your total cholesterol is 173 mg/dL, which is slightly above the recommended range. Your LDL is 80 mg/dL, which is a bit high. Your HDL is 63 mg/dL, which is a good indicator. Your triglycerides are 177 mg/dL, which is borderline high.\n\n**What You Should Do Next**\n\nSince your screening result is low and you have good control of your blood sugar, you should continue to follow your current diabetes management plan. Talk to your eye doctor about the best schedule for future screenings. The frequency of future screenings will depend on your individual risk factors and how well you are managing your diabetes.\n\n**Key Points to Remember**\n\n*   Your risk of developing diabetic retinopathy is low, but it's still important to be proactive about eye care.\n*   Good blood sugar control is the best way to protect your eyes.\n*   Continue to follow your current diabetes management plan.\n*   Schedule a follow-up retinal screening with your eye doctor as recommended.\n\n**Questions to Ask Your Eye Doctor**\n\n*   How often should I have my eyes checked?\n*   What specific changes can I make to my diabetes management plan to further reduce my risk of diabetic retinopathy?\n*   What are the signs and symptoms of diabetic retinopathy that I should be aware of?\n\nI hope this information is helpful.

    "gpt5_report": "## Understanding Your Retinal Screening Results\n\nYour eye photo screening did **not show signs of diabetic retinopathy** (the report says \u201cno apparent diabetic retinopathy\u201d). Diabetic retinopathy means **damage to the tiny blood vessels in the back of the eye (the retina)** that can happen over time with diabetes.\n\nThis result also comes with a probability estimate. **If we screened 10 people with similar photos and results, about 1 would have diabetic retinopathy and about 9 would not.** That\u2019s why the screening assessment says diabetic retinopathy is **unlikely**.\n\nIt\u2019s important to know this is a **screening test**, not a final diagnosis. Screening is meant to **catch problems early**, but it can sometimes miss early changes or flag something that turns out not to be an issue. The good news is your result is **routine**, which means no urgent eye treatment is suggested based on this screening.\n\n## Connecting Your Eye Health to Your Diabetes\n\nBlood sugar levels over time are one of the biggest drivers of diabetic retinopathy risk. Your lab HbA1c was **7.3**, which is above the usual diabetes goal for many people, meaning your blood sugar has been somewhat high over the past few months. Your CGM (continuous glucose monitor) tells a helpful day-to-day story: your average glucose was about **140**, and your estimated A1c from CGM (GMI) was about **6.7**.\n\nA strong positive sign is your **time in range**: **about 9 out of 10 readings (87.6 out of 100)** were in the target range (70\u2013180), and you had **no low readings below 70**. You did have some highs: **about 12 out of 100 readings** were over 180. Keeping blood sugar in range most of the time supports long-term eye health.\n\n## What You Should Do Next\n\n- **Continue your regular yearly eye exams** as recommended for people with diabetes (routine follow-up).\n- If you notice **new vision changes** (blurry vision, dark spots, sudden trouble seeing), **don\u2019t wait** for the yearly visit\u2014call your eye clinic sooner.\n- Keep working with your diabetes care team on steady glucose control. If your goal is to reduce risk over time, ask about ways to lower the \u201cabove range\u201d readings (the times over 180).\n- Maintain heart-healthy habits that also protect eyes (blood pressure, cholesterol, and smoking avoidance if relevant). Your blood pressure looks well controlled.\n\n## Key Points to Remember\n\n- This screening found **no visible diabetic retinopathy** in the images.\n- **Out of 10 people with similar screening results, about 1 may still have diabetic retinopathy and about 9 would not**, so follow-up exams still matter.\n- Your result is **routine**, meaning **yearly eye checks** are the right next step.\n- Your CGM shows you are in range most of the time, which is supportive for long-term eye health.\n\n## Questions to Ask Your Eye Doctor\n\n- \u201cDo I need a **dilated eye exam** today or at my next visit, or is the photo screening enough for me?\u201d\n- \u201cBased on my diabetes history and numbers, how often should I be checked\u2014**every year or more often**?\u201d\n- \u201cAre there any early warning signs in my eyes I should watch for between visits, and what symptoms should make me call right away?\u201d",

The good news is that the screening shows that diabetic retinopathy is unlikely.  It's important to remember that this is a screening, not a diagnosis.\n\nThe probability of having diabetic retinopathy is about 1 out of 10, or 5.8%. This means that, based on this screening, the chance of having the condition is fairly low.\n\nThe assessment indicates that if you *did* have diabetic retinopathy, it likely appears to be at a very mild stage, with no obvious signs.\n\nYour urgency level is ROUTINE, meaning you don't need any immediate action.\n\n**Connecting Your Eye Health to Your Diabetes**\n\nYour diabetes is well-controlled, which is great! Your HbA1c is in the pre-diabetic range, and your CGM shows that you are in range about 98% of the time. This indicates that you are doing a good job managing your blood sugar.\n\nYour lipid panel also looks good, with healthy cholesterol and triglyceride levels. Your kidney function is also normal.\n\nIt's important to remember that diabetes can affect your eyes, and regular screenings are crucial for early detection and prevention of complications.\n\n**What You Should Do Next**\n\nSince your screening is routine and shows no signs of diabetic retinopathy, you don't need any immediate action. However, we still recommend you continue with your regular eye exams as recommended by your eye doctor.\n\n**Key Points to Remember**\n\n*   Your diabetic retinopathy screening was negative.\n*   Your diabetes is well-controlled.\n*   Regular eye exams are essential for maintaining good eye health.\n\n**Questions to Ask Your Eye Doctor**\n\n*   How often should I schedule my next eye exam?\n*   Are there any specific eye conditions that are more common in people with diabetes, even though my current screening was normal?\n*   Is there anything else I can do to further protect my eye health?\n",
    "gpt5_report": "## Understanding Your Retinal Screening Results\n\nYour eye photo screening did **not** show signs of diabetic retinopathy. The grade was **\u201cno apparent diabetic retinopathy,\u201d** which means the screening did not see the common diabetes-related changes in the small blood vessels in the back of your eye (the **retina**, the light-sensing layer that helps you see).\n\nThis result is **probabilistic**, not a yes/no diagnosis. Based on the screening model, your chance of having diabetic retinopathy is low. Put in everyday terms: **If we screened 10 people with similar results, about 1 would have diabetic retinopathy and about 9 would not.** That \u201c1 out of 10\u201d is why follow-up eye care still matters\u2014even when the screening looks normal.\n\nBecause this is a **screening test**, it can sometimes miss early or subtle changes, and it does not replace a full eye exam. The good news is your screening urgency is **ROUTINE**, which means there is no sign you need urgent eye treatment right now.\n\n## Connecting Your Eye Health to Your Diabetes\n\nDiabetic retinopathy is more likely when blood sugar stays high over time. Your lab **HbA1c was 5.8**, which is in the **pre-diabetes range**, and your fasting glucose was **84**, which is in a typical fasting range. Your continuous glucose monitor (CGM) also looked steady: your average glucose was **120**, and you were in the target range (**70\u2013180**) for **about 98 out of 100 readings**. You were above 180 for **about 2 out of 100 readings**, and you had **no low readings** below 70.\n\nThis kind of stable pattern generally supports eye health. Still, eye changes can develop slowly, and age and other health factors can play a role. Keeping blood sugar, blood pressure, and cholesterol/triglycerides in good ranges helps lower risk over time.\n\n## What You Should Do Next\n\n- **Keep routine eye care:** **Continue your regular yearly eye exams** as recommended for people with diabetes/pre-diabetes.\n- **Seek earlier care if symptoms show up:** Call your eye doctor sooner if you notice blurry vision, new floaters (specks), flashes of light, or a dark \u201ccurtain\u201d in your vision.\n- **Support eye health with overall health goals:** Keep working on healthy eating, activity, and any plan from your clinician to manage blood sugar. Also keep monitoring blood pressure. (Your BP was **131/66**.)\n- **Ask about triglycerides:** Your triglycerides were **250**, which can be higher than ideal. Discuss with your clinician what this means for you and what steps could help.\n\n## Key Points to Remember\n\n- This was a **screening**, not a final diagnosis, but it **did not show retinopathy**.\n- In natural numbers: **out of 10 people with similar screening results, about 1 might have retinopathy and about 9 would not**.\n- Your CGM results were very steady (**about 98 out of 100 readings in range**), which is supportive for eye health.\n- **Routine yearly eye exams** are still important, because eye changes can start without symptoms.\n\n## Questions to Ask Your Eye Doctor\n\n- \u201cDoes my eye exam show **any early changes**, even if the screening looked normal?\u201d\n- \u201cBased on my health history, should I stay with **yearly exams**, or come in more often?\u201d\n- \u201cAre there **other eye problems** (like cataracts or macular issues) that I should be watched for at my age?\u201d",

Your HbA1c is in the normal range, and your fasting glucose is also good. The CGM data shows that you're in range a very high percentage of the time \u2013 about 95% of the time. This indicates that you're doing a great job of keeping your blood sugar levels within the target range. This good control helps to protect your blood vessels, including those in your eyes, from damage.\n\n**What You Should Do Next**\n\nSince your retinal screening results are reassuring, you don't need to do anything special right now.

This matches your **ROUTINE** screening result.\n- **Schedule sooner** if you notice new symptoms such as blurry vision, dark spots, flashing lights, or sudden vision changes.\n- Talk with your primary care clinician about:\n  - **Blood pressure control** (since it is elevated).\n  - **Triglyceride lowering** (often helped by food choices, activity, and sometimes medication).\n- Because vision differs between your eyes (your left eye reading suggests worse vision), ask your eye doctor if you need **extra testing** (like a full dilated exam or imaging) to explain that difference.\n\n## Key Points to Remember\n\n- This was a **screening**, not a definite diagnosis, but it found **no apparent diabetic retinopathy**.\n- In natural numbers: **about 1 out of 100** people with similar results may still have retinopathy; **about 99 out of 100 do not**.\n- Your CGM shows **strong time-in-range (about 95 out of 100 readings)**, which supports eye health.\n- Keeping **blood pressure and triglycerides** under control can also protect your eyes.\n\n## Questions to Ask Your Eye Doctor\n\n- \u201cDo I need a **dilated eye exam** today, or is the yearly schedule enough based on this screening?\u201d\n- \u201cMy left eye vision seems worse than my right\u2014what could be causing that, and what tests should we do?\u201d\n- \u201cWhat should I watch for at home that would mean I should come in sooner than a year?\u201d",

The report says your probability of diabetic retinopathy is about 0 out of 10. This means that based on this screening, it's unlikely that you have diabetic retinopathy. The assessment also indicates that if diabetic retinopathy were present, it would appear to be at a very early, mild stage, or not present at all.\n\n**Connecting Your Eye Health to Your Diabetes**\n\nIt's important to remember that diabetic retinopathy is a complication of diabetes, and good blood sugar control is key to preventing it. Your HbA1c is currently in the pre-diabetic range, and your CGM shows that you spend about 99.5% of the time within your target blood sugar range. This is great news! It means that you are doing a good job of managing your blood sugar, which is helping to protect your eyes and your overall health.\n\n**What You Should Do Next**\n\nSince your screening shows a very low risk, you don't need to do anything specific *right now*. However, it is important to continue to monitor your blood sugar regularly. Keep your eye doctor's appointment for your next screening scheduled. Your eye doctor will be able to assess your eye health in person and provide any further guidance you need.\n\n**Key Points to Remember**\n\n*   Your risk of diabetic retinopathy is low.\n*   Good blood sugar control is crucial for preventing diabetic retinopathy.\n*   Continue monitoring your blood sugar as recommended by your doctor.\n*   Your next eye exam is important for continued monitoring.\n\n**Questions to Ask Your Eye Doctor**\n\n*   How often should I have my eyes checked?\n*   What are the early signs of diabetic retinopathy?\n*   Are there any lifestyle changes I can make to further protect my eye health?\n",
    "gpt5_report": "## Understanding Your Retinal Screening Results\n\nYour retinal screening looked for signs of **diabetic retinopathy**, which means **damage to the tiny blood vessels in the back of the eye (the retina)** that can happen after long periods of high blood sugar. This screening found **no apparent diabetic retinopathy**, and the overall assessment is that diabetic retinopathy is **unlikely**.\n\nThis result is **probabilistic**, meaning it estimates how likely the condition is, not whether you definitely do or do not have it. Based on this screening, the chance of diabetic retinopathy is about **1 out of 100 people** with similar results. Put another way: **If we screened 10 people with similar results, about 0 would have diabetic retinopathy and about 10 would not.** Because this is a **screening test**, it cannot be a final diagnosis\u2014rarely, early or subtle changes can be missed. Still, your result is reassuring.\n\n## Connecting Your Eye Health to Your Diabetes\n\nEye blood vessels can be sensitive to blood sugar ups and downs over time. Your glucose tracking looks very steady: your continuous glucose monitor (CGM) showed an average glucose of **124 mg/dL** over **10 days**, and your readings were **in the target range (70\u2013180) for about 10 out of 10 readings** (99.5%). You had **almost no high readings** (about 0\u20131 out of 200 readings were over 180).\n\nYour HbA1c of **6.3** is in the **pre-diabetes range**, and your CGM \u201cestimated A1c\u201d (GMI) was also **6.3**, which matches. Keeping blood sugar steady like this supports long-term eye health.\n\n## What You Should Do Next\n\n- **Routine follow-up:** Continue your **regular yearly eye exams** as recommended for people with diabetes/pre-diabetes.\n- **Keep up your glucose habits:** Your CGM pattern is strong\u2014aim to maintain similar stability with your current lifestyle plan.\n- **Protect overall health:** Extra body weight (BMI **37.8**) can raise future diabetes risk. If you\u2019re open to it, ask your primary care clinician about a plan for gradual, realistic weight loss and activity that you can stick with.\n- **Watch for symptoms and act sooner if needed:** Call an eye doctor sooner than your yearly visit if you notice **new blurry vision, dark spots, flashing lights, or sudden vision changes**.\n\n## Key Points to Remember\n\n- This was a **screening**, not a definite diagnosis, but it found **no signs** of diabetic retinopathy.\n- Based on this screening, **about 1 out of 100** people with similar results may have diabetic retinopathy; **about 99 out of 100 do not**.\n- Your CGM results show **very stable glucose** (about **10 out of 10 readings in range**), which supports eye health.\n- **Routine yearly eye exams** are still important, because eye changes can develop over time.\n\n## Questions to Ask Your Eye Doctor\n\n- \u201cDo you see **any early changes at all** in my retina, even minor ones, and should I do anything differently?\u201d\n- \u201cGiven my blood sugar history and pre-diabetes, should I stay on a **yearly** schedule, or come back sooner?\u201d\n- \u201cAre there other eye issues you\u2019re watching for (like **glaucoma or macular problems**), and what symptoms should make me call right away?\u201d",
