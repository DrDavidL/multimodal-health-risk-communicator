This means the screening did **not detect** signs of diabetes-related damage to the small blood vessels in the retina (the light-sensing layer at the back of the eye).\n\nThe screening result says **\u201cdiabetic retinopathy is unlikely\u201d** and the urgency level is **ROUTINE**. This result is **probabilistic**, which means it estimates how likely the condition is based on the image.\n\nIf we were screening 10 people with similar results, about **1** would have diabetic retinopathy and **9** would not.\n\n**Important:** This is a **screening test**, not a final diagnosis. Screenings are very helpful, but they can miss early changes or be affected by image quality. That\u2019s why regular eye exams are still recommended, even when the screening looks normal.\n\n## Connecting Your Eye Health to Your Diabetes\n\nRetinopathy often develops slowly over time, and your glucose levels suggest your diabetes risk is **pre-diabetes** (your HbA1c was 5.8, and your continuous glucose monitor (CGM) estimated A1c was about 5.9). Your CGM shows you were in the target range (**70\u2013180 mg/dL**) for **about 10 out of 10 readings** (98.9% time in range), with **very little time high** (about 0 out of 100 readings above 180 mg/dL) and **almost no time low** (about 0 out of 100 readings below 70 mg/dL).\n\nThis level of glucose control generally supports good long-term eye health. Keeping glucose steady helps protect the small blood vessels in the retina from damage over time.\n\n## What You Should Do Next\n\n- **Continue your ROUTINE eye exams** as recommended for people with diabetes risk.\n- **Schedule a yearly dilated eye exam** if you are age 50 or older, or sooner if you notice vision changes. You had a **normal vision (0.02)** on today\u2019s screening.\n- **Keep up your current diabetes management plan**, including regular glucose checks and support for blood sugar that runs close to your target (your CGM looked steady, but small day-to-day swings can still add up).\n- **Seek earlier care** if you notice new symptoms like blurry vision, new floaters (spots), flashes of light, or a curtain-like shadow in your vision.\n\n## Key Points to Remember\n\n- This was a **screening**, and it found **no apparent diabetic retinopathy**.\n- Based on the screening, **about 1 out of 10** people with similar results would still have retinopathy, and **about 9 out of 10** would not.\n- Your glucose levels have been generally **in the target range**, which supports eye health over time.\n- **Routine yearly eye exams** are still important for everyone with diabetes risk, even when the screening looks normal.\n\n## Questions to Ask Your Eye Doctor\n\n- \u201cDo you recommend a **dilated eye exam** for me, and how often should I come back based on my risk and screening result?\u201d\n- \u201cDid the photo screening capture all the vessels in my retina, or should I still expect **full retinal imaging** when I come in?\u201d\n- \u201cAre there any early changes you can see that a screening test might miss, and what symptoms should make me call you sooner than my yearly visit?\u201d",
    "gpt5_report": "## Understanding Your Retinal Screening Results\n\nYour eye photo screening did **not** show signs of diabetic retinopathy. Diabetic retinopathy is damage to the small blood vessels in the back of the eye (the retina) that can happen after long-term high blood sugar. Based on this screening, **diabetic retinopathy is unlikely**, and the urgency level is **routine**.\n\nThis result is **probabilistic**, meaning it gives a \u201cbest estimate,\u201d not a final yes/no answer. **If we screened 10 people with similar results, about 1 would have diabetic retinopathy and about 9 would not.** Screening tests can sometimes miss early disease or flag something that turns out not to be a problem, so the safest plan is to keep up with regular eye exams.\n\nThe screening also found **age-related macular degeneration (AMD)**. AMD is a common age-related change in the macula (the part of the retina used for sharp, central vision). This does **not** mean you are going blind, but it is important to discuss with an eye doctor so they can confirm it and guide next steps.\n\n## Connecting Your Eye Health to Your Diabetes\n\nDiabetic retinopathy risk is strongly linked to blood sugar over time. Your lab HbA1c is **5.8**, which is in the **pre-diabetes** range (higher than normal, but not in the diabetes range). Your continuous glucose monitor (CGM) also looks steady: average glucose **107 mg/dL**, and your readings were in the usual target range (**70\u2013180**) for **about 99 out of 100** readings. You had **about 1 out of 100** readings below 70 and **0 out of 100** above 180.\n\nIn general, steadier blood sugar patterns lower the chance of diabetes-related eye damage. Your current glucose pattern supports why the screening suggests retinopathy is unlikely. Still, eye health can change over time, and AMD is a separate finding that deserves follow-up.\n\n## What You Should Do Next\n\n- **Routine follow-up:** Continue your **regular yearly eye exams** as recommended for people with diabetes (and often also recommended for people with pre-diabetes or higher risk).\n- **Confirm the AMD finding:** Ask for a **dilated eye exam** (drops that widen the pupils) and whether any **retina imaging** is needed to confirm AMD and check how mild it is.\n- **Support eye and overall health:** Work with your primary care clinician on steps that can improve long-term risk, such as healthy weight goals (your BMI is 33.6), blood pressure maintenance (124/70 is good), and triglyceride improvement (168 is mildly high).\n\n## Key Points to Remember\n\n- This is a **screening**, not a definite diagnosis; it\u2019s meant to guide what to do next.\n- **Out of 10 people like you, about 1 may have diabetic retinopathy and about 9 may not.**\n- Your screening image showed **no apparent diabetic retinopathy**, and the plan is **routine** follow-up.\n- **AMD was detected**, so it\u2019s important to discuss it with an eye doctor even though retinopathy looks unlikely.\n\n## Questions to Ask Your Eye Doctor\n\n1. \u201cCan you **confirm whether I have AMD**, and if so, what type and how mild is it?\u201d\n2. \u201cDo you see **any early signs of diabetic retinopathy** on a dilated exam, even if the screening looked normal?\u201d\n3. \u201cHow often should I have eye exams given my **pre-diabetes (A1c 5.8)** and this screening result?\u201d",

It also means the level of blood sugar in your eye vessels looks **normal** in this screening.\n\nThis result is **probabilistic**, which means it\u2019s an estimate, not a sure answer. Based on the screening, the chance of diabetic retinopathy is **about 4.6 out of 100 people** with similar screening results\u2014in other words, **about 5 out of 100**. Out of **10 people** with similar screening results, **about 0** would have diabetic retinopathy and **about 10** would not.\n\nThis is a **screening**, not a final diagnosis.

That\u2019s why regular eye exams are still important\u2014they confirm what the screening suggests and catch problems sooner if they exist.\n\n## Connecting Your Eye Health to Your Diabetes\n\nDiabetes can raise the risk of diabetic retinopathy (damage to the small blood vessels in the retina, the light-sensing layer in the back of the eye). Your diabetes health information looks **stable**. Your lab HbA1c is **5.0**, which is in the normal range, and your fasting glucose was **62 mg/dL**, also in the normal range. Your CGM (continuous glucose monitor) shows an average glucose of **91 mg/dL** over **10 days** with **about 8 out of 10 readings in range**. You also had **about 1 out of 10 readings below range** and **about 0 out of 10 above range**. There was **some low glucose** (very low: **about 3 out of 100 readings**), and your glucose variability (how bumpy the readings are) was **high** (coefficient of variation **38**), which can sometimes stress the eyes over time. Keeping glucose close to your target range most of the time can help support long-term eye and overall health.\n\n## What You Should Do Next\n\n- **Routine follow-up:** Continue your **routine** yearly eye exams as recommended for people with diabetes (or with risk factors).\n- **Keep up your current plan:** Continue your CGM and lifestyle choices that are working (average glucose around **91**, about **8 out of 10** readings in range).\n- **Address low glucose:** Because you had **about 3 out of 100 low readings**, it\u2019s reasonable to discuss these with your clinician. Lows can sometimes stress the eyes. Ask: \u201cShould I adjust my insulin or food timing to reduce my low readings?\u201d\n- **Seek care sooner** if you notice symptoms like new blurry vision, new floaters (spots), flashes of light, or a curtain-like shadow in your vision.\n\n## Key Points to Remember\n\n- **This is a screening result:** It suggests retinopathy is unlikely, but it is **not a definite diagnosis**.\n- **Out of 10 people with similar screening results, about 0** would have diabetic retinopathy and **about 10** would not.\n- Your glucose data shows **stable diabetes control**, and your CGM shows **about 8 out of 10 readings in range**.\n- **Keep your regular yearly eye exams** as a safety measure.\n\n## Questions to Ask Your Eye Doctor\n\n- \u201cDid you see **any early or subtle changes** in my retina, even if they don\u2019t look like full retinopathy?\u201d\n- \u201cHow often should I have eye exams given my age and health history?\u201d\n- \u201cAre there any warning signs I should watch for between visits, and when should I call you?\u201d\u2013 and what are those warning signs?

Your urgency level is **ROUTINE**, meaning nothing in this screening suggests you need an urgent eye visit.\n\nThis result is **probabilistic**, which means it estimates how likely a problem is, but it does not give a definite diagnosis. Based on this screening, the chance of diabetic retinopathy is about **0 out of 10 people** with similar results (and about **10 out of 10 would not** have it). Because all screenings can miss early or subtle changes, it\u2019s still important to keep up with regular eye exams.\n\n## Connecting Your Eye Health to Your Diabetes\n\nDiabetic retinopathy is damage to the small blood vessels in the back of the eye (the **retina**, the \u201cseeing layer\u201d). It is most often linked to long-term high blood sugar. Your lab numbers suggest **healthy average blood sugar** (HbA1c **5.0**, estimated CGM A1c **about 5.5**), which supports the low likelihood seen on the eye screening.\n\nThat said, your CGM shows **blood sugar swings**, including **lows**: about **2 out of 10 readings** were below 70, and about **0 out of 10 readings** were very low (below 54) at times. Big ups and downs can affect how you feel day to day and can be a safety concern, even if the average is okay. Keeping glucose steadier is generally helpful for overall health, including eye health.\n\n## What You Should Do Next\n\n- **Continue routine yearly eye exams** as recommended (even when the screening looks normal).\n- Bring this screening result to your next eye appointment and ask if you need any follow-up photos or a dilated eye exam (an exam where drops widen the pupil to see the retina better).\n- Because your CGM shows **frequent lows**, talk with your primary care clinician about possible causes (meal timing, medications/supplements, illness, alcohol, or sensor issues) and how to reduce lows safely.\n- Keep working on heart-and-vessel health (important for eyes too): your blood pressure and cholesterol look generally good; ask your clinician for a plan that also supports weight and overall fitness.\n\n## Key Points to Remember\n\n- This was a **screening**, not a final diagnosis\u2014but it looks **reassuring**.\n- If we screened **10 people** with similar results, about **0 would have diabetic retinopathy** and about **10 would not**.\n- **Yearly eye exams** are still important because early changes can be missed or develop later.\n- Your average glucose looks healthy, but your CGM shows **more lows and variability** than expected\u2014worth reviewing with your clinician.\n\n## Questions to Ask Your Eye Doctor\n\n1. \u201cDo you recommend a **dilated eye exam** even though my screening was normal, and how often should I repeat screening?\u201d\n2. \u201cAre there any **early or subtle retina changes** you want to watch over time based on my images?\u201d\n3. \u201cGiven my health history, what are the best steps to **protect my vision** over the next year?\u201d",

A **dilated eye exam** (where the eye doctor uses drops to widen the pupil) is the best way to confirm or rule out diabetic retinopathy. This screening looked at images and used an algorithm, so it can miss early or subtle changes, and it can sometimes flag changes that are not actually retinopathy.\n\n## Connecting Your Eye Health to Your Diabetes\n\nBlood sugar over time can affect the retina. Your **HbA1c is 8.0**, and your **continuous glucose monitor (CGM)** shows an average glucose of **180 mg/dL** over **about 10 days**. Your CGM also shows you were **in the target range (70\u2013180 mg/dL) for about 6 out of 10 readings**, and **above 180 about 4 out of 10 days**. You were **very high above 250 about 1 day out of 10**. These patterns can put stress on the retina over time, and they are why early detection matters.\n\n## What You Should Do Next\n\n- **Schedule an urgent eye exam** within **1\u20132 weeks**, especially since the screening suggests **more advanced changes**.\n- **Call sooner** if you notice new blurry vision, dark spots, flashing lights, or sudden vision loss.\n- **Work with your diabetes care team** (doctor, diabetes educator, registered dietitian) to improve blood sugar control. Ask: \u201cHow can my current plan help lower my average glucose and reduce my risk of eye damage?\u201d\n- Keep your blood pressure **around 130/80**, as high blood pressure can worsen retinopathy and may affect kidney function (your creatinine is **1.7**, which is higher than some people\u2019s).\n- **Bring your lab results** with you to the eye visit, and ask if any changes should be made to your diabetes treatment plan right away.\n\n## Key Points to Remember\n\n- This is a **screening result**, not a final diagnosis, and it shows **likely** diabetic retinopathy with **more advanced changes**.\n- **Out of 10 people with similar screening results, about 8 may have retinopathy and about 2 may not**.\n- **Urgent follow-up** is recommended because of the screening grade and risk level.\n- Your CGM shows glucose is **often high**, which can increase eye risk over time.\n\n## Questions to Ask Your Eye Doctor\n\n1. \u201cDo you see **diabetic retinopathy in my retina**, and what grade is it (e.g., mild, moderate, severe)?\u201d\n2. \u201cDo you recommend **any treatments** (like laser or injections) today, or should I wait, and what\u2019s the best follow-up schedule?\u201d\n3. \u201cShould I also get a **dilated eye exam** (not just a photo-based screening) to confirm the results?\u201d",

Diabetic retinopathy means **damage to the small blood vessels in the back of the eye (the retina)**. The retina is the \u201cfilm\u201d of the eye that helps you see.\n\nYour screening result estimates a high chance of diabetic retinopathy. **If we screened 10 people with similar results, about 8 would have diabetic retinopathy and about 2 would not.** This is why the result is marked **URGENT**. Still, it\u2019s important to know: **a screening is not a final diagnosis.** It is a strong warning sign that you need a full eye exam to confirm what\u2019s going on and decide on treatment.\n\n## Connecting Your Eye Health to Your Diabetes\n\nHigh blood sugar over time can harm the tiny blood vessels in the retina. Your diabetes numbers show your sugar has often been higher than the goal range. For example, your continuous glucose monitor (CGM) shows you were **above 180** for about **4 out of 10 readings**, and **very high (over 250)** for about **1 out of 10 readings**. Your average glucose was about **180**, which fits with an A1c in the diabetes range (your lab HbA1c was **8.0**).\n\nThese patterns can increase the chance of retinal damage and may help explain why this screening flagged more advanced changes. The good news is that **finding this early and acting quickly can protect vision**.\n\n## What You Should Do Next\n\n- **Schedule an appointment with an eye specialist (ophthalmologist) within 2 weeks.** Tell them your screening was **urgent** and \u201cdiabetic retinopathy is likely with more advanced changes.\u201d\n- **Ask for a dilated eye exam** (eye drops that widen the pupil) and retinal imaging if they recommend it. This is how they confirm the diagnosis and severity.\n- **Seek care sooner (same day/next day)** if you notice sudden vision changes, new floaters, flashing lights, or a dark \u201ccurtain\u201d over vision.\n- **Work with your diabetes care team this month** to improve glucose control safely.

Your screening found **no apparent diabetic retinopathy**, which suggests **no visible signs** of damage in the photos taken.\n\nThis result is based on a **screening**, not a definite diagnosis. Screenings are meant to **check for signs** and flag people who may need closer follow-up. Because of this, the result is also given as a **probability**: **about 1 out of 10 people with similar screening results will have diabetic retinopathy, and about 9 out of 10 will not.** In other words, diabetic retinopathy is **unlikely**, but it\u2019s not impossible.\n\n## Connecting Your Eye Health to Your Diabetes\n\nBlood sugar levels over time affect the eyes. Your continuous glucose monitor (CGM) shows an average glucose level of **140 mg/dL** over **6.3 days**, with **about 9 out of 10 readings in the target range (70\u2013180)** and **about 1 out of 20 above 180**. The CGM estimate of your A1c (**about 6.7**) is slightly higher than your lab A1c (**about 7.3**), meaning your average sugar may have run a little higher than your lab report.\n\nBlood sugar swings can stress the retinal blood vessels. Keeping glucose more steady is one way to support long-term eye health. Your body weight (**BMI 26**), blood pressure (**112/75**), and cholesterol (**LDL 80**, **HDL 63**) are also important for overall health, including eye health.\n\n## What You Should Do Next\n\n- **Continue your regular yearly eye exams** as recommended for people with diabetes (this **routine** follow-up is important).\n- **Keep working with your diabetes care team** to confirm what the CGM and lab A1c suggest about your glucose control and discuss steps to reduce high sugar spikes.\n- **Seek sooner care** if you notice new vision changes (blurry vision, dark spots, flashing lights) or symptoms like pressure in the eyes, double vision, or sudden vision loss.\n- **Schedule** an eye photo screening in **1 year**\u2014it fits your \u201croutine\u201d urgency level.\n\n## Key Points to Remember\n\n- This is a **screening**, not a definite diagnosis; **your screening looks reassuring** with **no visible signs** today.\n- **Out of 10 people** with similar screening results, **about 1 will have diabetic retinopathy** and **about 9 will not**.\n- Your CGM shows **about 9 out of 10 readings in range**, which supports eye health over time, but higher-than-lab A1c suggests room for improvement.\n- **Routine yearly eye exams** are the best way to catch early changes and protect vision.\n\n## Questions to Ask Your Eye Doctor\n\n- \u201cDo you see **any early changes** in my retina that a screening might miss?\u201d\n- \u201cBased on my diabetes history and CGM results, should I come back **sooner than once a year**?\u201d\n- \u201cAre there other eye conditions I should be watching for (like **glaucoma** or **cataracts**), and what symptoms should make me call sooner?\u201d",

Your lab HbA1c was **7.3**, which is above the usual diabetes goal for many people, meaning your blood sugar has been somewhat high over the past few months.

You did have some highs: **about 12 out of 100 readings** were over 180. Keeping blood sugar in range most of the time supports long-term eye health.\n\n## What You Should Do Next\n\n- **Continue your regular yearly eye exams** as recommended for people with diabetes (routine follow-up).\n- If you notice **new vision changes** (blurry vision, dark spots, sudden trouble seeing), **don\u2019t wait** for the yearly visit\u2014call your eye clinic sooner.\n- Keep working with your diabetes care team on steady glucose control. If your goal is to reduce risk over time, ask about ways to lower the \u201cabove range\u201d readings (the times over 180).\n- Maintain heart-healthy habits that also protect eyes (blood pressure, cholesterol, and smoking avoidance if relevant). Your blood pressure looks well controlled.\n\n## Key Points to Remember\n\n- This screening found **no visible diabetic retinopathy** in the images.\n- **Out of 10 people with similar screening results, about 1 may still have diabetic retinopathy and about 9 would not**, so follow-up exams still matter.\n- Your result is **routine**, meaning **yearly eye checks** are the right next step.\n- Your CGM shows you are in range most of the time, which is supportive for long-term eye health.\n\n## Questions to Ask Your Eye Doctor\n\n- \u201cDo I need a **dilated eye exam** today or at my next visit, or is the photo screening enough for me?\u201d\n- \u201cBased on my diabetes history and numbers, how often should I be checked\u2014**every year or more often**?\u201d\n- \u201cAre there any early warning signs in my eyes I should watch for between visits, and what symptoms should make me call right away?\u201d",

Diabetic retinopathy is damage to the small blood vessels in the retina that can happen after years of higher-than-normal blood sugar over time. Your screening result also says the chance of retinopathy is **low** and the urgency is **routine**.\n\n**Understanding Your Retinal Screening Results**\n\nThis screening found **no visible signs of diabetic retinopathy**. Diabetic retinopathy is often called \u201cdiabetic eye disease,\u201d and it\u2019s most closely linked to higher blood sugar levels over time. Your screening result is **probabilistic**, which means it estimates risk, but it\u2019s **not a final diagnosis**.\n\nBased on the screening, **if we screened 10 people with similar results, about 2 would have retinopathy and about 8 would not**. This is an approximate guide, and it\u2019s important to keep up with regular eye exams as recommended for people with diabetes (even when the screening looks normal).\n\nThe screening is very good at spotting changes, but it may miss early problems or miss very subtle changes. Also, blood sugar levels can change quickly, so a screening result can sometimes be affected by a temporary spike or dip in sugar.\n\n## Connecting Your Eye Health to Your Diabetes\n\nYour diabetes numbers look very steady: your **A1c is 5.8 (in the pre-diabetes range)** and your **fasting glucose is 84 mg/dL**. Your continuous glucose monitor (CGM) also shows strong average sugar control: your average glucose was **120 mg/dL** and you were in the target range (**70\u2013180**) for **about 98 out of 100 readings**. You had little time above range (**about 2 out of 100 readings)** and **no time below range**, which supports long-term eye health.\n\nImproving blood sugar over time does help protect the eyes, but it\u2019s also important to manage other risk factors that affect blood vessels. Your **triglycerides are higher than ideal (250 mg/dL)**, and your **blood pressure is 131/66**, which is borderline high. Improving these numbers can support healthy blood flow to the eyes.\n\n## What You Should Do Next\n\n- **Routine follow-up:** Continue your **regular yearly eye exams** as recommended for people with diabetes or pre-diabetes.\n- **Keep glucose steady:** Keep the good habits you\u2019ve been using to keep your CGM in range (**about 98 out of 100 readings**). If you notice low sugars often, work with your clinician to confirm if there is an underlying cause.\n- **Check other health factors:** Ask your clinician about a plan to lower your triglycerides and blood pressure, such as diet changes, exercise, or medication.\n- **Watch for changes:** Call your eye doctor sooner (not routine follow-up) if you notice new blurry vision, dark spots, flashes of light, or a curtain-like shadow in your vision.\n\n## Key Points to Remember\n\n- This is a **screening result**, not a definite diagnosis.\n- Out of **10 people with similar screening results, about 2 would have retinopathy and about 8 would not**.\n- Your CGM shows **stable sugar control**, which supports long-term eye health.\n- **Yearly eye exams** are still important, even when the screening looks normal.\n\n## Questions to Ask Your Eye Doctor\n\n- \u201cDo you see **any early changes** in my retina, even small ones?\u201d\n- \u201cWhat is the best schedule for my eye exams given my diabetes level (pre-diabetes) and age?\u201d\n- \u201cAre there other changes in my eyes that you want to watch (like cataracts or glaucoma), and do I need a different screening test?\u201d",
    "gpt5_report": "## Understanding Your Retinal Screening Results\n\nYour eye photo screening did **not** show signs of diabetic retinopathy. The grade was **\u201cno apparent diabetic retinopathy,\u201d** which means the screening did not see the common diabetes-related changes in the small blood vessels in the back of your eye (the **retina**, the light-sensing layer that helps you see).\n\nThis result is **probabilistic**, not a yes/no diagnosis. Based on the screening model, your chance of having diabetic retinopathy is low. Put in everyday terms: **If we screened 10 people with similar results, about 1 would have diabetic retinopathy and about 9 would not.** That \u201c1 out of 10\u201d is why follow-up eye care still matters\u2014even when the screening looks normal.\n\nBecause this is a **screening test**, it can sometimes miss early or subtle changes, and it does not replace a full eye exam. The good news is your screening urgency is **ROUTINE**, which means there is no sign you need urgent eye treatment right now.\n\n## Connecting Your Eye Health to Your Diabetes\n\nDiabetic retinopathy is more likely when blood sugar stays high over time. Your lab **HbA1c was 5.8**, which is in the **pre-diabetes range**, and your fasting glucose was **84**, which is in a typical fasting range. Your continuous glucose monitor (CGM) also looked steady: your average glucose was **120**, and you were in the target range (**70\u2013180**) for **about 98 out of 100 readings**. You were above 180 for **about 2 out of 100 readings**, and you had **no low readings** below 70.\n\nThis kind of stable pattern generally supports eye health. Still, eye changes can develop slowly, and age and other health factors can play a role. Keeping blood sugar, blood pressure, and cholesterol/triglycerides in good ranges helps lower risk over time.\n\n## What You Should Do Next\n\n- **Keep routine eye care:** **Continue your regular yearly eye exams** as recommended for people with diabetes/pre-diabetes.\n- **Seek earlier care if symptoms show up:** Call your eye doctor sooner if you notice blurry vision, new floaters (specks), flashes of light, or a dark \u201ccurtain\u201d in your vision.\n- **Support eye health with overall health goals:** Keep working on healthy eating, activity, and any plan from your clinician to manage blood sugar. Also keep monitoring blood pressure. (Your BP was **131/66**.)\n- **Ask about triglycerides:** Your triglycerides were **250**, which can be higher than ideal. Discuss with your clinician what this means for you and what steps could help.\n\n## Key Points to Remember\n\n- This was a **screening**, not a final diagnosis, but it **did not show retinopathy**.\n- In natural numbers: **out of 10 people with similar screening results, about 1 might have retinopathy and about 9 would not**.\n- Your CGM results were very steady (**about 98 out of 100 readings in range**), which is supportive for eye health.\n- **Routine yearly eye exams** are still important, because eye changes can start without symptoms.\n\n## Questions to Ask Your Eye Doctor\n\n- \u201cDoes my eye exam show **any early changes**, even if the screening looked normal?\u201d\n- \u201cBased on my health history, should I stay with **yearly exams**, or come in more often?\u201d\n- \u201cAre there **other eye problems** (like cataracts or macular issues) that I should be watched for at my age?\u201d",

The continuous glucose monitor (CGM) data shows an average glucose of **132** with **about 2 out of 3 readings in the target range (70\u2013180)**. You were in range **about 95 out of 100 days** on the CGM.\n\nBecause your glucose levels are mostly steady and in range, that supports long-term eye health. However, even with good average glucose, blood pressure and triglycerides can influence retinopathy risk. Your blood pressure is **146/87**, which is **higher than ideal**, and your triglycerides (**393**) are elevated. These other health markers can affect blood vessels, including those in the eyes.\n\n## What You Should Do Next\n\n- **Continue your regular yearly eye exams** as recommended for people with diabetes (or prediabetes).\n- Keep up your current diabetes lifestyle plan: **regular meals, active habits, and blood pressure support**.\n- Seek care sooner than the next yearly visit if you notice: **new blurry vision, dark spots, flashing lights, or a curtain-like shadow in your vision**.\n- Ask your clinician about **blood pressure goals** and whether medication or lifestyle changes could help.\n- Ask about **HDL cholesterol** and whether a plan to improve it is right for you.\n\n## Key Points to Remember\n\n- This is a **screening**, not a definite diagnosis; it suggests diabetic retinopathy is **unlikely**.\n- **Out of 10 people** with similar screening results, **about 1** may have retinopathy and **about 9** may not.\n- Your CGM shows **about 95 out of 100 days** in the target range, which supports eye health.\n- Your blood pressure (**146/87**) and triglycerides are **higher than ideal**, which can affect eye health.\n\n## Questions to Ask Your Eye Doctor\n\n1. \u201cDo you see **any early changes** in my retina, even if they are subtle?\u201d\n2. \u201cGiven my diabetes history and eye results, how often should I have an eye exam **and what symptoms** should make me call sooner?\u201d\n3. \u201cWhat other eye conditions are present or possible, and should I be checked for them?\u201d",

Your continuous glucose monitor (CGM) shows an average glucose of **132 mg/dL**, with **about 95 out of 100 readings in the target range (70\u2013180)** and **about 5 out of 100 readings above 180**. That pattern generally supports lower risk for eye damage.\n\nEven with good glucose numbers, other health factors can affect eye blood vessels. Your blood pressure is **146/87**, which is higher than ideal, and your triglycerides are **393**, which is quite high. Managing blood pressure and fats can also help protect vision.\n\n## What You Should Do Next\n\n- **Continue your regular yearly eye exams** as recommended for people with diabetes/prediabetes. This matches your **ROUTINE** screening result.\n- **Schedule sooner** if you notice new symptoms such as blurry vision, dark spots, flashing lights, or sudden vision changes.\n- Talk with your primary care clinician about:\n  - **Blood pressure control** (since it is elevated).\n  - **Triglyceride lowering** (often helped by food choices, activity, and sometimes medication).\n- Because vision differs between your eyes (your left eye reading suggests worse vision), ask your eye doctor if you need **extra testing** (like a full dilated exam or imaging) to explain that difference.\n\n## Key Points to Remember\n\n- This was a **screening**, not a definite diagnosis, but it found **no apparent diabetic retinopathy**.\n- In natural numbers: **about 1 out of 100** people with similar results may still have retinopathy; **about 99 out of 100 do not**.\n- Your CGM shows **strong time-in-range (about 95 out of 100 readings)**, which supports eye health.\n- Keeping **blood pressure and triglycerides** under control can also protect your eyes.\n\n## Questions to Ask Your Eye Doctor\n\n- \u201cDo I need a **dilated eye exam** today, or is the yearly schedule enough based on this screening?\u201d\n- \u201cMy left eye vision seems worse than my right\u2014what could be causing that, and what tests should we do?\u201d\n- \u201cWhat should I watch for at home that would mean I should come in sooner than a year?\u201d",

Diabetic retinopathy means **damage to the tiny blood vessels in the retina** (the light-sensing layer in the back of the eye) that can sometimes happen with diabetes.\n\nBased on the screening, the chance of diabetic retinopathy is **very low** on this screening day. If we screened **10 people** with results like yours, **about 0 would** have diabetic retinopathy and **about 10 would not**. This result is reassuring, but it\u2019s also a **screening test**, not a final diagnosis. Screenings can sometimes miss early changes or flag something that turns out not to be the real problem.\n\n## Connecting Your Eye Health to Your Diabetes\n\nDiabetes can raise the risk of diabetic retinopathy over time. Your lab HbA1c is **6.3**, which is in the **pre-diabetes range**, and your CGM (continuous glucose monitor) average was **124 mg/dL**, with **about 99 out of 100 readings in the target range** (70\u2013180). Your glucose was mostly steady and low, which supports long-term eye health.\n\nEven with glucose that runs in a healthy range most of the time, **blood sugar swings** can still stress the small blood vessels in the eyes over years. That\u2019s why regular eye exams are important for people with diabetes and pre-diabetes.\n\n## What You Should Do Next\n\n- **Keep your routine follow-up** as recommended for your age and diabetes status\u2014**nothing urgent** right now.\n- **Continue your current plan:** Your glucose patterns look stable, and that\u2019s a good sign for eye health.\n- **Schedule a yearly eye exam** (dilated eye exam recommended) as recommended for people with diabetes and pre-diabetes.\n- **Speak with your clinician** if you notice new symptoms like blurry vision, new floaters (spots), flashes of light, or a curtain-like shadow in your vision.\n\n## Key Points to Remember\n\n- This screening found **no apparent diabetic retinopathy**, and the chance of retinopathy is **very low**.\n- **Out of 10 similar people, about 0 would have retinopathy and about 10 would not.**\n- This is a **screening**, not a final diagnosis, and **screenings can miss early changes**.\n- Your glucose trends are **steady**, which supports eye health, but **regular exams** still matter.\n\n## Questions to Ask Your Eye Doctor\n\n- \u201cDo you recommend **dilated eye exams** for me, and how often?\u201d\n- \u201cDid you see **any early changes** in my retina, even subtle ones?\u201d\n- \u201cBased on my history and these results, should I come in **sooner than yearly**?\u201d",
    "gpt5_report": "## Understanding Your Retinal Screening Results\n\nYour retinal screening looked for signs of **diabetic retinopathy**, which means **damage to the tiny blood vessels in the back of the eye (the retina)** that can happen after long periods of high blood sugar. This screening found **no apparent diabetic retinopathy**, and the overall assessment is that diabetic retinopathy is **unlikely**.\n\nThis result is **probabilistic**, meaning it estimates how likely the condition is, not whether you definitely do or do not have it. Based on this screening, the chance of diabetic retinopathy is about **1 out of 100 people** with similar results. Put another way: **If we screened 10 people with similar results, about 0 would have diabetic retinopathy and about 10 would not.** Because this is a **screening test**, it cannot be a final diagnosis\u2014rarely, early or subtle changes can be missed. Still, your result is reassuring.\n\n## Connecting Your Eye Health to Your Diabetes\n\nEye blood vessels can be sensitive to blood sugar ups and downs over time. Your glucose tracking looks very steady: your continuous glucose monitor (CGM) showed an average glucose of **124 mg/dL** over **10 days**, and your readings were **in the target range (70\u2013180) for about 10 out of 10 readings** (99.5%). You had **almost no high readings** (about 0\u20131 out of 200 readings were over 180).\n\nYour HbA1c of **6.3** is in the **pre-diabetes range**, and your CGM \u201cestimated A1c\u201d (GMI) was also **6.3**, which matches. Keeping blood sugar steady like this supports long-term eye health.\n\n## What You Should Do Next\n\n- **Routine follow-up:** Continue your **regular yearly eye exams** as recommended for people with diabetes/pre-diabetes.\n- **Keep up your glucose habits:** Your CGM pattern is strong\u2014aim to maintain similar stability with your current lifestyle plan.\n- **Protect overall health:** Extra body weight (BMI **37.8**) can raise future diabetes risk. If you\u2019re open to it, ask your primary care clinician about a plan for gradual, realistic weight loss and activity that you can stick with.\n- **Watch for symptoms and act sooner if needed:** Call an eye doctor sooner than your yearly visit if you notice **new blurry vision, dark spots, flashing lights, or sudden vision changes**.\n\n## Key Points to Remember\n\n- This was a **screening**, not a definite diagnosis, but it found **no signs** of diabetic retinopathy.\n- Based on this screening, **about 1 out of 100** people with similar results may have diabetic retinopathy; **about 99 out of 100 do not**.\n- Your CGM results show **very stable glucose** (about **10 out of 10 readings in range**), which supports eye health.\n- **Routine yearly eye exams** are still important, because eye changes can develop over time.\n\n## Questions to Ask Your Eye Doctor\n\n- \u201cDo you see **any early changes at all** in my retina, even minor ones, and should I do anything differently?\u201d\n- \u201cGiven my blood sugar history and pre-diabetes, should I stay on a **yearly** schedule, or come back sooner?\u201d\n- \u201cAre there other eye issues you\u2019re watching for (like **glaucoma or macular problems**), and what symptoms should make me call right away?\u201d",
