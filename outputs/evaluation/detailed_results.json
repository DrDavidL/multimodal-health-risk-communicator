An A1c of 8.0% means your average sugar has been running high over the last 2\u20133 months.\n- **Fasting glucose (178 mg/dL)**: Also higher than the usual target.\n- **CGM (about 10 days of data)**:  \n  - Your average glucose was **180 mg/dL**.  \n  - **Time in range (70\u2013180)** was **about 56%**. That means **about 6 out of 10 readings** were in the target range.  \n  - **Above 180** was **about 44%** (**about 4 out of 10 readings**).  \n  - **Very high (>250)** was **about 10%** (**about 1 out of 10 readings**).  \n  - **Low sugar** was **0%** (good\u2014no lows seen).\n- **Weight (BMI 38.7)**: In the obesity range, which can make diabetes harder to control.\n- **Blood pressure (130/87)**: Slightly above ideal; blood pressure control helps protect eyes and kidneys.\n- **Cholesterol**: Overall looks **fair** (LDL 79 is often a good level for diabetes).\n- **Kidney marker (creatinine 1.72)**: Higher than expected and may suggest **reduced kidney function**. This needs follow-up.\n- **Vision**: Right eye better than left; the left eye shows more blur.\n- **Memory/thinking (MoCA 18/30)**: Suggests **mild cognitive impairment**, which can make medication routines harder.\n\n### Connecting Eye Health to Diabetes\nYour eye exam shows **diabetic retinopathy**, meaning high blood sugar has affected the small blood vessels in the retina. When sugar is high **often** (like your CGM shows about **4 out of 10 readings** above range), it raises the risk of bleeding, swelling, and vision loss. **Blood pressure and kidney health** are also closely linked to eye health.\n\n### What You Should Do Next\n1. **See an eye specialist (retina/ophthalmology)** soon and follow their treatment plan. Ask if you have **macular edema** (swelling) and how severe the retinopathy is.\n2. **Work with your diabetes clinician** to lower highs safely (since you had **0 out of 10 lows**, there may be room to improve without causing low sugar).\n3. **Check kidney health**: ask for **eGFR and urine albumin (ACR)** and review medications.\n4. **Support routines**: because memory scores are lower, consider pill organizers, alarms, or a family helper.\n\n### Key Points to Remember\n- About **6 out of 10** glucose readings were in range; aim to move closer to **7\u20138 out of 10** if your clinician agrees.\n- Eye changes from diabetes can worsen silently\u2014**regular visits matter**.\n- Controlling **blood sugar + blood pressure** helps protect eyes and kidneys.\n\n### Questions for Your Eye Doctor\n- What stage of diabetic retinopathy do I have (mild/moderate/severe)?\n- Do I have **macular edema** or bleeding?\n- How often should I return for exams or imaging (OCT/photos)?\n- Do I need treatment now (laser, injections), or close monitoring?\n- What vision changes should make me call right away?",
